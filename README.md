# Board-Game-Arena-Tutorial
09/25/2024

This repository saves the code I used while following the Board Game Arena Studio tutorial called Reversi.

I've worked on this tutorial while alone as part of my Comps project, I do not own any of the code here and only use this as a learning experience in order to understand the development process of creating a game for Board Game Arena.
